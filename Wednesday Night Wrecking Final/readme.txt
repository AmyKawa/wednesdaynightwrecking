~~~Wednesday Night Wrecking~~~

So u ever heard the game Friday Night Funkin'? So a guy named James Landino released a song called Wednesday Night Wrecking
so I, being the law abiding citizen I am, ripped off the name of his song for my game.

Pretty cool huh

I initially was not going to make a rhythm game for my final, I decided it was too hard for me, until my friend Tim said to
make an OMORI gacha simulator x Rhythm game as a joke, so I told my dad as a joke but he was serious when he said it was a
good idea and told me to do it. I was hesitant but I figured since I know my way around osu!mania data and Python I could try
to give it a shot. Now I'm not too sure about the gacha simulator but the rhythm game sure.

I made the rhythm game engine functioning properly in 3-4 days, so I guess it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Still a
lot of frustration and I'd probably still be very stuck if it wasn't for Chris.

So extra special thanks to Tim, Dad, and Chris

I've made a working gacha simulator before, but I probably won't implement it for the sake of the awful pygame memory storage. The
game having so many images rn, so many moving images and opening such large text files is causing the game to be on life support. 
I can't even play it on the school computer's without it lagging to the point of non-functionability. Woohoo!
But still, I'm having a blast. And if you can't play this, just get a better PC lol!

I want to implement OMORI theme in some way, but it seems i'm just going for anime aesthetic rn

anyways yeah thats it thx for reading and hopefully playing
