* First day of starting the project! I thought about it for like 2 days and today is the day I actually start this!!
* Planning for the project begins
* Theorized map data files and the system (https://i.imgur.com/734wGU5.png)
* I can't believe I was against using a class for notes lol (https://i.imgur.com/Fkd0wGF.png)
* More brainstorming (https://i.imgur.com/Jl3gpun.png)

May 2nd, 2023 - 
* Coded map converter. It converts .osu data of a mania map to data I can read (extract lane and start offset)
* Convert will convert LNs too, but will leave that out until LN support is added
* Coded note falling, seems to work in code (print statements) but not visually. Just a long stream of pink down one lane
* Added first map, Rhythm Hell charted by Ryax. Perfect for testing. Long delay at start, no chords and no LNs, as well as a short song!

May 3rd, 2023 -
* Falling notes finally work (had to implement self.y to each note so they fall independently for the fall function)
* Due to fall math, can only play maps with at least 800ms delay at the start
* Split map data into metadata and mapdata, split mapdata again into individual lanes and can access data using lane#[0][index]
* This allows for easier access to data and for checking

May 4th, 2023 -
* Added 2nd map, Bison Charge
* Added basic results screen
* Chris helped with key detection using numerous variables and constantly changing to only detect one key press for one frame
* This prevents users holding down key and pygame continuously recognizing a keydown press
* You can now hit notes
* Accuracy detection implemented
* Falling crashes on the last note, so set the fall code to only trigger when there is still notes left to be fallen (len(list) > 0)
* Implemented missing when you don't hit a note in time
* Implemented judgements (perf, great, bad) due to ms difference
* There is a bug where if you hit too many fast notes the game crashes? (look into that)
* Implemented similar concept to falling, only trigger hit and miss code when there is data left to calculate (len(list) > 0)
* Added grades based on accuracy %
* The first successful runthrough happened on Rhythm Hell, got to results screen with proper accuracy counts and a grade
* Added full combo detector
* Major bug detected: lane lists are empty much too early, causes all calculations to be messed up (hitting and missing don't work)

May 5th - 7th, 2023:
* Went in circles trying to figure out why lanes were deleting too early, causing game crashing and the game to not work
* Tried many things with trying to get empty lists to not trigger code
* It seems the bug only triggers when you have a mix of hits and misses, a full combo or full miss run does not have any bugs
* Empty list if statement would fix crashing but it had no functionability, you could only watch notes fall down and not play
* Realized that having the hit as one function and miss as just one function was detecting multiple if statements at the same time, 
  causing two notes to delete at the same time and therefore emptying lists too early
* Split the hit and miss functions into 4 functions each (one for each key) for a total of 8 functions
* Miraculously this fixed the issue, GAME IS NOW WORKING AND FULLY FUNCTIONAL!!!!!!!!! WOOHOOO!!!
* First successful runthrough on Bison Charge that contained a mix of misses and hits, can definitely say the game is working now!! :D

May 8th, 2023:
* Note accuracy detection is working, but visually when it's too fast, the notes cannot delete the visual
* Added new variable that turns True when the note self.y is too low, so deleting notes now have two conditions, when it's hit or missed
  or fallen too far despite the notes being hit (this is only a visual bug so i'm not too worried about it plus I fixed it sort of)
* It still is a little ugly because I need a Y value lower than a miss Y value, but it gets back on track as you play so no complaints
* Transferred map loading and metadata loading codes to functions
* Added menu with buttons, clicking on it loads the map so now I can play numerous maps without changing code
* Mouse over a button will reveal the metadata of the corresponding map
* Transferred game to USB stick for easier portability

May 9th, 2023:

May 18th, 2023 -
* Added import gc (garbage collect) for optimization (solved lag issue)

May 19th, 2023 - 
* Added background to title screen, as well as 4 animated OMORI FNF gifs that randomize every instance
* happy_twins loading screen added (it was in files but I forgot to add it to the game)
* Added tutorial with my own gifs and tips

June 6th, 2023 - 
* Took a very large break from the project lol
* Redid the title screen to resemble WHITE SPACE, door is interactable and acts as a begin button

June 7th, 2023 - 
* White space objects all converted into interactable items
* Upon hover, it grows in size
* Laptop turned into instructions screen

June 8th - 14th, 2023 -
* More white space additions
* OMORI and MEWO now have varied dialogue
* Sketchbook added with 13 pages. Now includes quotes from my classmates and friends, as well as game credits
